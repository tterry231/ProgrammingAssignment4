## TAT - UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Codebook

This codebook describes the data in the completed data set generated by run_analysis.R.

The data is output to a .txt file, "new_tidy_data.txt", which can be used for further analysis.

## Contents of new data set

# The new tidy data set contains 4 columns

* activity
* subject
* measurement
* mean

# The data set is grouped by activity and subject with a mean generated for each individual measurement

# The list of possible activities are

* LAYING
* SITTING
* STANDING
* WALKING
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS

# There are a total of 30 subjects included in the data set with a numeric identifier, 1:30

# The list of possible measurements are

# The mean value is in the unit of "g's" (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2).

# As part of the cleaning process the following variable names were changed using the transformations below.

* filtered_feature_vars <- gsub("\\(\\)", "", filtered_feature_vars)
* filtered_feature_vars <- gsub("Acc", "-acceleration", filtered_feature_vars)
* filtered_feature_vars <- gsub("Mag", "-Magnitude", filtered_feature_vars)
* filtered_feature_vars <- gsub("^t(.*)$", "\\1-time", filtered_feature_vars)
* filtered_feature_vars <- gsub("^f(.*)$", "\\1-frequency", filtered_feature_vars)
* filtered_feature_vars <- gsub("(Jerk|Gyro)", "-\\1", filtered_feature_vars)
* filtered_feature_vars <- gsub("BodyBody", "Body", filtered_feature_vars)

* All variables were then converted to Lower Case.
